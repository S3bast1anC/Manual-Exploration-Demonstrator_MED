# Manual-Exploration-Demonstrator_MED
The Manual Exploration Demonstrator (MED) is a rover developed to test hands-on exploration capabilities. Inspiration from Mechanical Sciences’ - [Design and analysis of a six-wheeled companion robot with mechanical obstacle-overcoming adaptivity](https://ms.copernicus.org/articles/12/1115/2021/). This repo provides an overview of MED's design, components, and operational guidelines to facilitate its use and maintenance.

## About MED
### Motivation
MED's main concept was a six-wheel rover with two freely rotating rear arms. This rover was created for the Mars Habitat at Berkeley (MHAB) software sub-team for autonomous code testing. The rover's modular design allows for future modifications, whether through hardware upgrades or software adjustments. Its six-wheel configuration allows  navigation across complex terrain, while the rotating rear arms provide additional support for overcoming obstacles. We hope that the information shared may inspire future rover projects. 



Different approaches were considered, earlier designs were going to use a rod across the body of the frame connecting the two arms holding the motors.  “self-adaptive obstacle-crossing robot”MED was created in order to have a rover to have test code
